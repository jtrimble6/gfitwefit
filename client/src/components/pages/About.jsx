                       Jennifer spent two decades working twelve hour shifts as a Dispatcher and 911 operator.  She is no stranger to the negative mental and physical effects of working long hours in a desk-bound environment. Fitness became the perfect outlet while also decreasing the challenges that can be associated with having Type One diabetes for nearly a lifetime.  Jennifer dedicates her personal journey to inspire her clients to live stronger lives, both mind and body. <br /> <br />
